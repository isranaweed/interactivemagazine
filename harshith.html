My name is Harshith Gutha and I am a rising senior at Denmark High School in Alpharetta, GA. I play tennis in my free time and on the school team. 
I am heavily involved in FBLA as I have competed all three years of high school and have been an officer since 10th grade. 
I enjoy coding and programming as well as learning new languages and concepts. Currently, I am part of the TAG-Ed Tomorrow's Technologists Camp at Georgia Tech. 
In my free time, I continue to pursue other coding languages and mastering their uses.  
I wish to pursue higher education after high school through university, and preferably, a college within Georgia. 
I want to attain a major in Computer Science but also focus on entrepreneurship and business administration.
